# FactoryPattern

This package contains example code of:
- Simple Factory, represented by `SimplePizzaFactory` protocol
- The factory method pattern, represented by `PizzaStore` protocol
- The abstract factory pattern

**The Simple Factory** isn't a design pattern itself. It's a simple way to decouple the object creation from concrete classes.

**The Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

**The Abstract Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.
